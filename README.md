# Priority-Based-Patient-Care
This project is a simulation of a healthcare management system that optimizes patient treatment scheduling using a Job Scheduling Algorithm and Priority Queues. Patients are prioritized based on the severity of their condition (e.g., critical, serious, normal), ensuring that those in urgent need receive timely care.
