# Priority-Based-Patient-Care
This project is a simulation of a healthcare management system that optimizes patient treatment scheduling using a Job Scheduling Algorithm and Priority Queues. Patients are prioritized based on the severity of their condition (e.g., critical, serious, normal), ensuring that those in urgent need receive timely care.

# 🏥 Patient Health Care Management System

A Java GUI-based healthcare management system that schedules and prioritizes patient treatments using a **Job Scheduling Algorithm** and **Priority Queues**. This system simulates how hospitals can efficiently manage patient flow based on the urgency of medical conditions.

## 💡 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how data structures like **priority queues** can be applied in a real-world healthcare scenario. Each patient is assigned a priority based on their condition:
- **Critical**
- **Serious**
- **Normal**

The system schedules treatments using a job scheduling algorithm, ensuring that patients in more critical condition are treated first. The GUI allows users to:
- Add patient information
- Assign condition levels
- View the dynamic patient queue in real-time
